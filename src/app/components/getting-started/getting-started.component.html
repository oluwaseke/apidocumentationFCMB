        Open Banking. <br />
        <strong>Open Banking</strong> product is for FinTechs or super agents
        who needs access to APIs to enable FCMB customers carry out transactions
        on their channels or enable the Fintech to have access their own
        accounts for statement, balance and transactions. <br />
        <strong>BaaS product</strong> is for FinTechs that are interested in
        owning a banking relationship where a scheme code is allocated for them
        to open accounts and transact with those accounts through our API. This
        means they open account for third parties and also facilitate
        transactions on those accounts.

        Once subscription is completed, you will be routed to the subscription
        window where you see your list of subscriptions and their status. If the
        state remains submitted, it means the profile is yet to be activated by
        the bank.
